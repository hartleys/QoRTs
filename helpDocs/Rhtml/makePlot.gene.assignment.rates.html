<h2>
Gene assignment rate plot
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots the rate at which reads are assigned into various 
categories.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
makePlot.gene.assignment.rates(plotter,  debugMode, singleEndMode, ...)
                         
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>plotter</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <code>QoRT_Plotter</code> reference object. See <code><a href="build.plotter.html">build.plotter</a></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>debugMode</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical. If TRUE, debugging data will be printed to the console.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>singleEndMode</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical. Determines whether the dataset consists of single-ended reads. 
By default this is determined from the data. Thus, this parameter should 
never need to be set by the user.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>Arguments to be passed to methods, such as
<a href="../../graphics/html/par.html">graphical parameters</a> (see <code><a href="../../graphics/html/par.html">par</a></code>).
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each bam-file, this function plots the rate (y-axis) for which the bam-file's read-pairs are assigned to the given categories.
</p>
<p>The categories are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><EM>Unique Gene</EM>: The read-pair overlaps with the exonic segments of one and only one gene. For many downstream analyses tools, such as DESeq, DESeq2, and EdgeR, only read-pairs in this category are used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><EM>Ambig Gene</EM>: The read-pair overlaps with the exons of more than one gene.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><EM>No Gene</EM>: The read-pair does not overlap with the exons of any annotated gene.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><EM>No Gene, Intronic</EM>: The read-pair does not overlap with the exons of any annotated gene, but appears in a region that is bridged by an annotated splice junction.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><EM>No Gene, 1kb from gene</EM>: The read-pair does not overlap with the exons of any annotated gene, but is within 1 kilobase from the nearest annotated gene.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><EM>No Gene, 10kb from gene</EM>: The read-pair does not overlap with the exons of any annotated gene, but is within 10 kilobases from the nearest annotated gene.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><EM>No Gene, middle of nowhere</EM>: The read-pair does not overlap with the exons of any annotated gene, and is <EM>more</EM> than 10 kilobases from the nearest annotated gene.
</p>
</li></ul>
