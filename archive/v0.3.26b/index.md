# QoRTs: Quality of RNA-seq Tool-Set
v0.3.26
Revised Fri Nov  6 15:14:14 EST 2015

The QoRTs software package is a fast, efficient, and portable multifunction toolkit designed to assist in
the analysis, quality control, and data management of RNA-Seq datasets. Its primary function is to aid
in the detection and identification of errors, biases, and artifacts produced by paired-end high-throughput
RNA-Seq technology. In addition, it can produce count data designed for use with differential expression
and differential exon usage tools, as well as individual-sample and/or group-summary genome track
files suitable for use with the UCSC genome browser (or any compatible browser).

The entire QoRTs toolkit can be used in almost any operating system that supports java and R.

The most recent release of QoRTs is available on the [QoRTs github page](http://github.com/hartleys/QoRTs). Additional help and documentation is available online [here](http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/index.html). The creator and maintainer of QoRTs can be reached by emailing "QoRTs-contact" (at) list.nih.gov.

##Help Index:

* QoRTs vignette. User manual and general how-to. Available as a [pdf](doc/QoRTs-vignette.pdf) or [on the web](QoRTs-vignette/index.html).
* [Java jar utility help index.](jarHtml/index.html) The Java utility is responsible for the bulk of the data processing, and contains a number of useful tools. It must be run on all replicates.
* [R package help.](Rhtml/index.html) The R package is responsible for producing visualizations, graphs, plots, and summary tables. (also available as a [pdf](doc/QoRTs-manual.pdf))
* A [comprehensive walkthrough](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/example-walkthrough.pdf) of the entire analysis pipeline, run on a different [example dataset](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/QoRTsPipelineWalkthrough.zip)
* The raw [bam files](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/bamfiles.zip) for the example walkthough (File is ~1.1gb).
* The [Example QC data](QoRTsExampleData_LATEST.tar.gz) used in the vignette.
* [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.html): Check here if you run into problems!

##Citing QoRTs:
If you use QoRTs and find it helpful, you can cite it in your publications as:

Hartley SW, Mullikin JC. [**QoRTs: a comprehensive toolset for quality control and data processing of RNA-Seq experiments.**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4506620/) [*BMC Bioinformatics.*](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics) doi: 10.1186/s12859-015-0670-5


##INSTALLATION:
The R package can be installed in R using the command:

    > install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/QoRTs_LATEST.tar.gz",
                       repos=NULL, 
                       type="source");

The java jar file does not need to be installed, it can simply be downloaded and used directly.
Just execute it using the java command:
    
    java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar QC input.bam anno.gtf.gz /output/dir/

See the [FAQ](FAQ.html) if you have trouble installing QoRTs.

##EXAMPLE DATA:
The example QC output used in the vignette can be found on the github main page, and installed
with the command:
    
    install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/QoRTsExampleData_LATEST.tar.gz", 
                     repos = NULL, 
                     type="source")

The original bam files are too large to upload to github. 
These files can be found [here](
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/qorts/exData/QoRTsFullExampleData.zip). 
(File is ~1.5gb)

There is also a [comprehensive walkthrough](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/example-walkthrough.pdf) of 
the entire analysis pipeline, run on a different 
[example dataset](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/QoRTsPipelineWalkthrough.zip) with 
[example bam files](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/bamfiles.zip).

##COMMAND-LINE HELP:
Additional options and syntax information for the main QC java utility 
can be found using the command:

    java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar QC --man

Options and information about other sub-utilities within the java package
can be found using the command:

    java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar --man

And for each sub-utility:

    java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar utilname --man
    
For help with individual R functions in the R utility, use the R command:

    > help(functionname);

For a full listing of all help topics for the R utility, use the R command: 

    > help(package="QoRTs");
