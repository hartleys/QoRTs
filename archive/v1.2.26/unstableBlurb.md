Alternatively, the latest STABLE version can be installed using the command:

    > install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/QoRTs_STABLE.tar.gz",
                       repos=NULL, 
                       type="source");

The stable version may lack new features available in the latest version, but has undergone much more testing and is less likely to have problems.
