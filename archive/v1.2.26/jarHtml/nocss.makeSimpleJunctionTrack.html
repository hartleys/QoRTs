<h2>Help for java command "makeSimpleJunctionTrack"</h2>

<h2>USAGE:</h2>

<pre><code>java [Java Options] -jar QoRTs.jar makeSimpleJunctionTrack [options] indir fileType outdir
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>This utility converts QoRTs splice junction count files into bed format. Unlike makeJunctionTrack and makeOrphanJunctionTrack, this utility is not designed to compile multiple samples or replicates together. It is a simple converter from a QoRTs junction count file to a bed file. The count files come in 3 types: known, novel, and orphan.</p>

<h2>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>indir:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The data directory in which to find the splice junction count files. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>fileType:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type of splice junction counts to compile. Must be one of: [known,novel,orphan]. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>outdir:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The location to output the bed file. Traditionally the same as indir. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>--rgb r,g,b:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rgb color for all the bed file lines. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--sizeFactor val:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A double-precision floating-point value. If this option is set, all counts will be divided by the given normalization factor. (Double)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--includeSpliceNames:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that splice names should be used as well as splice counts. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--digits num:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of digits after the decimal to include in counts. CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED! (Int)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--filterMin val:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this option is set, then all bed lines with a count LESS THAN the given value will be dropped. (Double)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--filterMax val:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this option is set, then all bed lines with a count GREATER THAN the given value will be dropped. (Double)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--noGzip:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate whether whether input and output data is/will be gzip-compressed. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--maxIdentifierLength num:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The max number of characters a junction ID can have. If longer than this, the middle will be truncated. This is to prevent browser errors when the length of a bed line name is greater than 255 characters. (Int)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--outfileSuffix file.bed.gz:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The name of the output file. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--verbose:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that debugging information and extra progress information should be sent to stderr. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--quiet:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that only errors and warnings should be sent to stderr. (flag)</p>
