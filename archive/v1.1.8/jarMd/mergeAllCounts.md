## Help for java command "mergeAllCounts"

## USAGE:

    java [Java Options] -jar QoRTs.jar mergeAllCounts [options] infileDir decoderFile outfile


## DESCRIPTION:

This tool uses a replicate decoder to merge count/wiggle data of all techical replicates in a dataset, producing sample\-wise counts\. You must supply a replicate decoder which indicates which replicates are technical replicates of which samples\. This tool will then merges each sample's technical replicates using the "mergeCounts" function\.

## REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:
### infileDir:

> The top-level directory in which all the QC output can be found. This concatenated with the qc.data.dir column must equal the path to the raw QC output directories (String)


### decoderFile:

> The decoder file, which must conform to the requirements of the QoRT decoder specification. In particular it MUST have two specific columns: 
"sample.ID": This utility will merge the count data output from all bamfiles that have the same sample.ID
and
"qc.data.dir" (OR "unique.ID"): This must be the file path to the output data directory, from the infileDir file location. (String)


### outfile:

> The output file directory. (String)



## OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:
### --sampleID sampid:

> Optional: the id of the specific sample that is to be merged. By default, this utility will merge all samples found in the decoder. With this option selected, it will ONLY merge the one sample named here. (String)

### --additionalTrackOptions "track options":

> More options for the wiggle tracks. For more information refer to the wiggle track definition on the UCSC genome browser website. (String)

### --wiggleWindow val:

> The window size of the alternate-size wiggle track, if applicable. (Int)

### --mergeFiles file1[,file2,...]:

> A comma-delimited list of strings, indicating which file types to attempt to merge. By default, this utility autodetects the presence of all mergable qc files and merges all standard files. Valid codes are:DESeq,DEXSeq,JunctionSeq,NovelSplice,KnownSplice,WiggleTrack,WiggleTrackAltWin (CommaDelimitedListOfStrings)

### --noGzip:

> Flag to indicate whether whether input and output data is/will be gzip-compressed. (flag)

### --verbose:

> Flag to indicate that debugging information and extra progress information should be sent to stderr. (flag)

### --quiet:

> Flag to indicate that only errors and warnings should be sent to stderr. (flag)
