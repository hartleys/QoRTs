<h2>Help for java command "mergeNovelSplices"</h2>

<h2>USAGE:</h2>

<pre><code>java [Java Options] -jar QoRTs.jar mergeNovelSplices [options] infileDir sizeFactorFile annotation.gtf.gz outfileDir
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>This utility takes the QC output from the standard QC utility run on a series of samples and performs two functions: first, it compiles all splice junctions across all samples and filters low-coverage novel splice junctions by mean coverage across all samples (optionally normalized with user-supplied size factors). It then assigns unique identifiers to each novel splice junction that passed this filter, and outputs a special flat gff file listing all exons, annotated splice junctions and passed-filter novel splice junctions with assigned unique identifiers for all features. Next, it uses these unique identifiers to create a new set of JunctionSeq-formatted count files, one for each input sample. This new count file will include counts for the passed-filter novel splice junctions in addition to the usual counts for annotated splice junctions, exons, and aggregated-genes, all listed by the assigned unique identifiers.</p>

<h2>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>infileDir:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The input file directory. All samples should be contained inside this directory, in a subdirectory with the same name as the sample's sample.ID. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>sizeFactorFile:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file must contain (at least) two columns: one labelled 'sample.ID' and one labelled 'size.factor'.  Size factors can be generated using DESeq, EdgeR, DEXSeq, CuffLinks, or similar utilities. Rough size factors can be calculated simply by taking the read count for each sample and dividing it by the average read count across all samples. Note that this overly-simplistic 'total count' normalization method is NOT recommended. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>annotation.gtf.gz:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>An input gtf file, containing the reference transcript annotation. A number of transcript annotations are available from ensembl, UCSC, or RefSeq. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>outfileDir:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The output file directory. This can be the same as the input file directory, in which case this utility will simply place the merged novel/known count files in each sample's subdirectory. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>--minCount num:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The minimum mean normalized read coverage needed for inclusion of a novel splice junction. By default, equal to 10.0. (Double)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--minSpan len:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The minimum (genomic) distance threshold for novel splice junctions. 'Novel splice junctions' that span a distance smaller than this value will be IGNORED. This can be useful because many aligners do not distinguish between deletions and splice junctions. The default is 10 bp. (Int)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--stranded:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that data is stranded. This MUST be the same as the strandedness of the original QoRTs QC run. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--stranded_fr_secondstrand:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nonfunctional, as the strandedness rule will have already been applied. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--noGzipInput:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that input files are NOT be compressed into the gzip format. By default almost all input files are assumed to be compressed. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--noGzipOutput:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that output files should NOT be compressed into the gzip format. By default almost all output files are compressed to save space. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--verbose:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that debugging information and extra progress information should be sent to stderr. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--quiet:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that only errors and warnings should be sent to stderr. (flag)</p>
